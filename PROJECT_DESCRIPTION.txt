🏥 BREAST CANCER DETECTION APPLICATION
========================================

This is a comprehensive Flask-based web application for breast cancer analysis that combines traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches to provide accurate breast cancer predictions.

🎯 CORE PURPOSE
===============
The application serves as a medical diagnostic tool that can analyze breast cancer using two different approaches:
1. Form-based prediction using traditional ML with medical features
2. Image-based prediction using deep learning CNN models

🧠 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
=========================

Machine Learning Components:
- Traditional ML Model: Random Forest Classifier trained on 30 medical features from the breast cancer dataset
- Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for medical image analysis
- Ensemble Approach: Combines multiple pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) for better accuracy

Data Processing:
- Dataset: Uses the BUSI (Breast Ultrasound Images) dataset with 1,122 training images
- Classes: 3-class classification (Benign, Malignant, Normal)
- Image Processing: Automatic resizing, normalization, and feature extraction
- Feature Engineering: Medical feature analysis including intensity, variance, edge detection, LBP, and entropy

- User Authentication: Login/registration system with admin privileges

Prediction Capabilities:
- Form Prediction: Enter 30 medical features to get instant diagnosis
- Image Prediction: Upload medical images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF) for CNN analysis
- Confidence Scoring: Provides confidence levels for each prediction
- Fallback System: Heuristic-based prediction when models are unavailable

🔧 ADVANCED FEATURES
===================

Learning System:
- Automatic Learning: Models continuously improve from user feedback
