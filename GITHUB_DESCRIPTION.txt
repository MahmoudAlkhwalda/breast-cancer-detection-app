🏥 Breast Cancer Detection Application
=====================================

A comprehensive Flask web application for breast cancer analysis using both traditional machine learning and deep learning (CNN) approaches.

## Features

### 🔬 Dual Prediction Methods
- **Form-based**: Enter 30 medical features for instant diagnosis
- **Image-based**: Upload medical images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF) for CNN analysis

### 🧠 AI/ML Capabilities
- **Traditional ML**: Random Forest Classifier with 30 medical features
- **Deep Learning**: CNN with ensemble of pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2)
- **3-class Classification**: Benign, Malignant, Normal
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant results with confidence scores

### 🌐 Web Application
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface
- **User Authentication**: Login/registration with admin privileges
- **Admin Dashboard**: Prediction management and model training
- **Learning System**: Continuous model improvement from user feedback

### 📊 Dataset & Performance
- **BUSI Dataset**: 1,122 training images (627 benign, 309 malignant, 186 normal)
- **High Accuracy**: Both ML and CNN models achieve high accuracy
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast prediction response times
- **Scalable**: Multiple concurrent users supported

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask 2.3.3, SQLite
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow 2.13.0, scikit-learn 1.3.0
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV 4.8.0, PIL/Pillow
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
